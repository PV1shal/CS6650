Welcome to my Assignment 1 solution. 

# Genral description:
  - This repo was created with the idea of adding all the assignments in one repo so you will find the code for of all servers (Java & GO) code and all Clients (Client part 1 & Client part 2) codes together in a folder called Assignment1.
  - Assignment1 is the project Java Servlet Server.
  - Assignment1_go is the project Go Server.
  - Client is the JAVA multi-threaded client code.
      - Holds 2 packages: Client1 and Client 2.
      - Client1 is the solution for Client Part 1.
      - Client2 is the solution for Client Part 2.
      - All the CSV which I used to plot the graphs are available in src/main/resources.
